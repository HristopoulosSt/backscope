As of 2021 Oct, the instructions below are at least partly obsolete, as
the endpoint URL given does not work. An example working URL is given in the
README.

---

Follow instructions in README for getting the database set up

su <db_user> # password may be required depending on how you set up the database

cd /NumberscopeFlaskLocation/

psql <db_name>

\q

After these, try running flask and go to the endpoint

http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_sequence/A0001

Should return json data!
