As of 2021 Sep, the instructions below are at least partly obsolete, in that
the server appears to work without performing an init.sql step, and moreover
the endpoint URL given does not work. An example working URL is given in the
README.

---

To populate sequences with the init.sql file, follow these isntructions:

Follow instructions in README for getting the database set up

su <db_user> # password may be required depending on how you set up the database

cd /NumberscopeFlaskLocation/

psql <db_name>

\ir init.sql

\q

After these, try running flask and go to the endpoint

http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_sequence/A0001

Should return json data!
